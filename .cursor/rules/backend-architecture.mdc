description: Backend architecture conventions for NestJS modules, controllers, and services in QuikSpit Shine.
globs: backend/**/*.ts
---

Structure and conventions:

- Use NestJS module boundaries per domain
  - Modules: ContactModule, BookingModule
  - Controllers expose REST endpoints under /api
  - Services contain business logic; keep controllers thin

- Placeholder endpoints and logic
  - Contact: POST /api/contact to handle form submissions and image uploads
  - Booking: GET /api/bookings, POST /api/bookings (Stripe integration placeholder)

- Integrations (placeholders allowed)
  - Uploads: multer (local uploads folder in development)
  - Payments: Stripe keys via env; service stub
  - Email: nodemailer service with host/user/pass from env

- Configuration
  - Use TypeScript throughout
  - Read environment from .env with typed config where possible
