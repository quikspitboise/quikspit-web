globs: frontend/**/*.tsx,frontend/**/*.css

Accessibility rules:

- Focus states are mandatory for interactive elements
  - Use focus:ring-2 focus:ring-red-600 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-neutral-800
  - Ensure :focus-visible is respected to avoid excessive outlines

- Contrast
  - Primary text on dark backgrounds must meet WCAG contrast guidelines
  - Prefer text-neutral-300 for body text to reduce eye strain

- Motion
  - Respect prefers-reduced-motion; avoid unnecessary animations

- Hit targets and responsive behavior
  - Ensure adequate tap targets on mobile and consistent responsive grid spacing
